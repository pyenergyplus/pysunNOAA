poetry bumpversion

- https://pypi.org/project/poetry-bumpversion/
- poetry version patch
- poetry build
- poetry publish



moving to poetry for install and virtual env. Some observations

- twine needs setup.py
- if setup.py is there, pypi will not use toml
- bupmversion will not update toml
- for pypi
    - need to bump using poetry - google this
    - need to build and publish using poetry 
- right now the pysunnoaa file is a mess. pypi is not showing classifiers
- make a pure poetry project to see hwat it generates - not useful
- hand edit the toml file -> https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/
- looks like I need to use basic cookiecutter and then add poetry stuff to it :-(

python3 -m venv ~/venvs/pysunnoaa
source ~/venvs/pysunnoaa/bin/activate 

python3 -m venv ~/venvs/pysunnoaa_frompoet
source ~/venvs/pysunnoaa_frompoet/bin/activate
